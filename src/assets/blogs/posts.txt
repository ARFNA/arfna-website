1|Roshnee Sharma|Introduction||<h3><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I started this blog to help improve access to knowledge about coping with serious allergies, and further, create a community of individuals who struggle with food allergies.</p>&#10;<p>A lot of what I could find online was either super scientific, or a lot of parental blogs. All information is good information, but I was really struggling to find people documenting their individual experience with a peanut allergy:</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>What was it like to make friends?</li>&#10;<li>How do you travel with peanut allergies?</li>&#10;<li>How do you tell your partner about an allergy?</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<p>My last straw, prior to starting the blog, was when I wanted to start oral immunotherapy, and I couldn&#8217;t find any information on any person&#8217;s experience. I found some medical documents and marketing emails for a couple hospitals. I decided that this little corner of the internet is going to become our &#8220;one stop shop&#8221; for all things allergy.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>A little background about my allergy&#8230;</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I am officially an oral immunotherapy graduate as of 2022! However, for most of my young adult life (until the age of 23), I struggled with an incredibly severe allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame. I never knew what tree nuts specifically, but I had had a reaction to hazelnuts in the past that had become anaphylactic.</p>&#10;<p>If I touched a place where a nut had been present, and there was some leftover residue (think: sitting at a desk in college where someone had eaten a PB granola bar and there are crumbs), I would get hives down my arm. This made things very uncomfortable.</p>&#10;<p>In school, I had had an anaphylactic reaction to chicken nuggets that were made in Israel. My avoidance treatment had gotten to the point where my allergist had recommended that I don&#8217;t eat food that&#8217;s made outside of Canada or the USA because of the different food labeling standards, as well as to stay far away from anything that had may contain statements.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What&#8217;s the goal?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>My goal here is to form ARFNA into a community where we can share our experiences, great places to eat, new research being done, etc&#8230; I especially want to highlight coping tactics for the more severe allergies, since I know that there are varying degrees of tolerance that individuals have.</p>&#10;<p>Beyond the nonprofit accepting donations to help seed fund new research and a scholarship fund for individuals who would like to participate in oral immunotherapy, we want to be a resource that you can trust to get up-to-date information on all things nut allergies. I want to normalize some of the feelings that others might have with their food allergies by sharing my experiences beyond just the reactions, but the precautions too.</p><h3><strong>How do I help?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Please, share your experiences! I&#8217;m a strong believer that the more experiences people have access to, the more comfortable they can feel with what they&#8217;re feeling. When we are more vocal about the problems we face, we can recognize them and work towards finding solutions.</p><p>I&#8217;m so excited to share my story, and I cannot wait to hear yours!</p>|35ab/1ab/Ssphn0qGOrwOYWy.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-02-15 04:13:13|2023-02-15 15:07:57
2|Roshnee Sharma|Oral Immunotherapy (OIT)||"<h3><strong>Oral Immunotherapy</strong></h3>&#10;<p>It&#8217;s really difficult to find information online about oral immunotherapy. Or, backtracking, it&#8217;s really difficult to find firsthand information about a person&#8217;s experience going through it. There&#8217;s plenty of medical jargon that highlights both the risks and the life-changing benefits of the treatment.</p>&#10;<p>I find that there&#8217;s also not a lot of information about the long term process of immunotherapy &#8212; what is it like during the treatment and what does life look like afterwards? How do you maintain it? How do you eat your allergens? In this and future posts, I want to bring to light as much information as I can about the treatment from the perspective of someone who has gone through it.</p>&#10;<p>Note that this does not replace any medical advice &#8212; it&#8217;s purely my experience and all medical information is from allergists that I have worked with in the past.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What is Immunotherapy?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Immunotherapy is the treatment where you feed yourself a little bit of an allergen everyday. You slowly increase this amount to build up your tolerance. In my treatment, we worked our way up to 5g of my allergens (peanut, walnut, pecan, pine nuts, and sesame).</p>&#10;<h3><strong>How is this different than Palforzia?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I personally haven&#8217;t taken palforzia, so I can&#8217;t speak from an experience to compare the two. However, the main difference is Palforzia is only for peanuts and goes up to 1g. Because you take your peanuts in capsule form, you may not experience the same inner mouth scratching, which might mean that you still have that reaction when you start to eat whole nuts.</p>&#10;<p>The benefit of Palforzia is that it is FDA approved and can be covered by insurance.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Assessing the Treatment Plan</strong></h3>&#10;<p>For me, I was confused by the treatment because I was told my entire life to avoid even the slightest trace of a nut. I got skin reactions quite easily just through touch. I was positive that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have the most minuscule amount of tolerance to start this therapy, let alone continue it. My allergist, Dr Jon Welch from Olympia Allergy and Immunology, very quickly alleviated these concerns.</p>&#10;<p><em><font size=""3"">Everyone has a little bit of tolerance. It&#8217;s more a matter of finding what that little bit is and build up from there.</font></em></p><p><span><span>This in itself was so counterintuitive to how I was taught to manage my allergy, but also made a lot of sense. </span>Every body<span>&#160;has an amount where it starts to recognize that the food is present, so we find that and then slowly teach it that peanuts aren&#8217;t so bad.</span></span></p>&#10;<p>Another fear that worried me was having to increase the nuts I was taking, which would then result itself in a full blown anaphylactic attack. While we can&#8217;t debunk this entirely, it is important to recognize that we are increasing the amount of the allergen so slowly that the odds of a full blown anaphylactic attack are very slim. You may (and probably will) experience a minor reaction like stomach cramps or a hive. This is a good note to stop the current dose, down dose, and maintain for the next little bit.</p>&#10;<p>Another thing to remember is that all the increases in doses should happen in the presence of a doctor&#8217;s office. This means that the dose you are taking at home is a safe dose for your body and should not trigger a reaction &#8212; provided that you are not accidentally exposed to traces of nuts in a meal or go out to exercise and speed up the rate of digestion dramatically after eating the nuts.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Is this just for nuts?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Nope! My allergist was comfortable doing this procedure for any allergen (provided it&#8217;s an allergy and not something like Celiacs). Beyond that, we were able to tackle all 5 of my allergies at the same time, rather than having them staggered. For me, it&#8217;s been really great to have taken a few months to do this treatment and now be able to handle all cross contamination.</p>&#10;<p>But let&#8217;s suppose you have a dairy, egg, and peanut allergy. Oral immunotherapy can be for you and can help you eat a burger at McDonalds, for example, if you just hold the cheese. And, if things go well, you can build your tolerance to a free eating stage post-graduation, where then you <em>can</em> eat the cheese as well. Then you too can understand why there is absolutely no hype around McDonald&#8217;s American Cheese.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Is it for me?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I can&#8217;t answer that :) but I do think that the treatment itself has been such a life changing experience for me. When I started my new job and someone wanted to go to lunch at the cafeteria, I didn&#8217;t have to say &#8220;no, because they have signs all over that say &#8216;may contain&#8217;.&#8221; When I travel, I don&#8217;t have to be so afraid of someone eating peanuts next to me and just waiting to break out into a full anaphylactic shock in a plane.</p>&#10;<p>The point of the treatment is to avoid those accidental exposures. I don&#8217;t sit there and stuff my face with Reese&#8217;s cups just for the sake of it. But I can go to a bakery with friends and get a cupcake that has a risk of cross contamination.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Will my insurance cover it?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>No. This is because it&#8217;s not FDA approved.</p>&#10;<p>The reason it&#8217;s not FDA approved is not because it&#8217;s inherently dangerous. It&#8217;s mainly because this treatment isn&#8217;t a drug. It&#8217;s more like exposure therapy. However, I do hope that with time, they will start to view this as a medical procedure and insurance can start to cover it, because it would greatly improve people&#8217;s access to the treatment.</p>&#10;<p>Because you pay out of pocket at an allergy facility, it is very expensive. However, it is life-changing. Here at ARFNA, we do recognize this barrier though, and thus started a fund to help support people who would like to undergo the treatment. If you would like support with paying the bills, please feel free to reach out and we can work something out!</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What was my experience like?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Overall, my experience progressed without any major hiccups. I am grateful for this all the time. I didn&#8217;t have an anaphylactic response.</p>&#10;<p>The process started for me when I made an appointment with the local allergist to get some new epipens, as mine had recently expired. In the consultation, my doctor mentioned &#8220;we can treat that.&#8221; He had to say it a few times before I was actually able to process what he was saying.</p>&#10;<p>Once it registered, I was so excited. I went to the grocery store and looked at all the foods that may contain nuts (specifically in the grocery store dessert section). That itself was more than enough motivation for me.</p>&#10;<p>When I went to the doctor, we did a skin test to confirm what tree nuts and peanuts I was allergic to specifically. I also asked to add sesame seeds as I was having more and more issues when I consumed hummus, where the latest time I had had a bit, my throat and mouth was itching so much I had to take Benadryl. After that test, I was informed that I was allergic to peanuts, pine nuts, and sesame. This was news to me given my last reaction had been to hazelnuts, and I always struggled in golf tournaments when pecans were around. Due to my history, the doctor recommended that we started with an oral challenge.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What&#8217;s an oral challenge?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>An oral challenge is where you eat a food and see if you&#8217;re allergic to it. Seriously. I was terrified the first time we set out to do it with almonds. I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t allergic to almonds as I had been exposed to them when I was younger and nothing had happened. But this was a story my parents had shared with me and were also not positive about the exact details of the food that I had consumed.</p>&#10;<p>We started with 0.1g of almonds and worked our way up to 5g. The way we did it was starting with the almonds mixed with cellulose. So it started with</p>&#10;<p><em><font size=""3"">0.1g &#8212;&gt; 0.5g &#8212;&gt; 1g &#8212;&gt; 1g &#8212;&gt; 5g</font></em></p>&#10;<p>The two 1g options was one with this cellulose almond protein mixture (where there was 1g of almond), and then the second 1g was just crushed almonds. These were mixed into chocolate pudding. I would eat a dose, wait 20 minutes, and then we would take the next dose.</p>&#10;<p>I then did this for the rest of the tree nuts. I ended up reacting to pecans at the 5g mark. The reaction was very tiny (I got a couple hives starting to appear on my cheek. We simply waited and then the reaction went away on its own. I didn&#8217;t need Benadryl or anything. However, we decided to add pecan and its brother pair, walnut, to my immunotherapy treatment plan.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What&#8217;s next after the oral challenge?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>With the oral challenge round, we essentially determined that I wasn&#8217;t allergic to most tree nuts. This in itself was a crazy discovery, given how many issues I had had with them prior. We&#8217;re still not sure what changed, but we know that hormones randomly can impact food allergies, and since I was in my early 20s, things were still rapidly changing.</p>&#10;<p>To be safe when getting to a &#8220;free-eating&#8221; stage with the tree nuts, however, I ate them 2 times a week, and I increased the amount I would eating by 10%. As you can tell, that exponentially grows and before long, you can eat that food item in <em>anything</em> with confidence. I&#8217;ve had tons of Ferrero Rocher and Lindt Lindor truffles now.</p>&#10;<p>I was grateful that I got to do the oral challenge before the full treatment because I had a chance to see what it was like eating nuts within pudding and starting to measure it out.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Starting the immunotherapy</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I will create more resources that go into more depth through the stages of the immunotherapy. However, at a high level, it starts very similarly to the oral challenge. We started with a very diluted cellulose and nut protein mixture. I think we started with around 0.001g of all 5 nuts, so the amount I was consuming was extremely small.</p>&#10;<p>Later on, we progressed to consuming crushed nuts in pudding to get me from around 1g of the 5 nut mixture to 20g. By then, we hit the point of &#8220;graduation&#8221; and I moved on to eating the whole nuts. I&#8217;m currently in maintenance where everyday, I measure out 4g of all my nuts and I eat them. This allows me to be currently be safely exposed to 5g of any of my allergens.</p>&#10;<p>After sitting at maintenance for a couple months, because I don&#8217;t have an &#8220;aversion&#8221; to the nuts, we are going to work on increasing that dose slowly so that I can get to free eating.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What do I wish I knew?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>After starting this treatment and going through it with an allergist with 20 years of experience and a 98% success rate with the treatment, I learned that there is a difference between doing it at a facility and doing a human trial. The main thing is that in a human trial, you are still safe, but you have to recognize that there are things being &#8220;tried.&#8221; For example, my old manager&#8217;s daughter had gone through the treatment, and they did a test to see if they could 10x the amount of peanuts at the end of her treatment. She ended up having a reaction and having to go to the hospital. She was all good, but it is important to bear the additional risk in mind when a paper is being written about your treatment.</p>&#10;<p>I also wish I knew that actually eating the nuts would be a very confusing time, and there&#8217;d be a lot of mental roadblocks. First, you need to take the nuts at the same time everyday (or as similar as possible). This maintains your tolerance for the whole day. Second, reaching the plain nut stage where you can actually taste the nut is strange &#8212; I almost felt like I knew what peanuts tasted like despite having never eaten them before.</p>&#10;<p>I also wish I knew that eating the nuts themselves would upset my tummy in the beginning. It wasn&#8217;t a normal amount of &#8220;oh my stomach is a little upset.&#8221; These were horrible cramps, gas, and I would feel exhausted. I will cover these side effects more in a future blog post. However, as the week would progress, the symptoms would progressively get better until my next up-dose.</p>&#10;<p>I also wish I understood that the consumption and the touch allergy could make progress at different rates. For me, when I ate nuts and it would actually touch my tongue or throat, I would feel very itchy in my mouth. This was unpleasant, however, it was not dangerous. What was weird was needing to stay calm through the experience and recognize that sometimes eating nuts was not going to escalate itself into a full blown anaphylactic attack.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Would I do it again?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Yes.</p>&#10;<p>Knowing what I do now, I would definitely do this treatment again, despite some of the more painful parts of the experience. I love that I can eat new foods, try out any restaurant, and travel internationally without as much fear. I feel much more normal in social situations.</p>&#10;<p>Because I am so grateful for this experience, it is also why we started the ARFNA fund for immunotherapy.

3|Roshnee Sharma|Oral Immunotherapy: Part 1||"<p>This is part of a series! Read the overview of Oral Immunotherapy&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>&#10;<p>After I had completed my oral challenge, we had selected the nuts that I would be using in my oral immunotherapy treatment plan. One part that was unique about my immunotherapy journey is that I had allergies to multiple nuts that we wanted to tackle at once. So, in my journey, we batched multiple nuts together as part of the same treatment plan.</p>&#10;<p>I had some hang ups about having all the nuts being done at the same time because I was worried that perhaps I would start having a minor reaction to a pecan, and then that would decrease my tolerance for peanuts. However, that is not how it works. Your body has a built-in tolerance for all of the nuts, and they are independent of <font face=""Calibri"">each </font>other.</p>&#10;<p><i><font size=""3"">&#128161; It&#8217;s important still to note that while tolerance is assumed to be independent, there are still relationships between nuts and allergies. For example, almonds and cashews are brother-pairs &#8212;&gt; building tolerance for almonds might help with an allergy to cashews and vice versa.</font></i></p>&#10;<h3><strong>What do you end up eating during treatment?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I had a misconception when I started the immunotherapy that we would be measuring out the tiniest microgram of a peanut, and because it would be so small, I would hardly be able to see it. However, because we are dealing with such small amounts of an allergen, we actually create a bulk mix and average it out. In practice, this looks like a mixture of 9 grams of cellulose and 1 gram of peanut combined into a homogeneous powder. After that, we would measure out 0.1g of that mixture. Then, you are effectively consuming about 0.01g of the peanut.</p>&#10;<p>By dealing with a diluted mixture, it allows it to be a little easier to mix into whatever you are taking this powder with.</p>&#10;<p>The powder itself looks a little like drugs. It&#8217;s basically a white powder that has some of your allergen protein within it. Honestly, just by looking at the powder and smelling it, you can&#8217;t really tell that there are any nuts in it. This actually helps when you eat it for the first time, since oftentimes for those with allergies, the taste and smell can be quite a turn off.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What does the first appointment look like?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Hopefully by the time you&#8217;re reaching your first appointment, you&#8217;ve had a consultation with your doctor and you&#8217;ve discussed the whole process. If you haven&#8217;t had that opportunity, I would highly recommend you do not begin until that happens.</p>&#10;<p>The overall appointments last around 3-4 hours. I would recommend bringing some sort of entertainment for when you get there. For me, because I work in software, I was able to bring my computer and just schedule no meetings during that time. However, arrangements with your employer or school may look different.</p>&#10;<p>My first appointment started with eating a small amount of my nutty mixture mixed into chocolate pudding. A lot of people like to eat theirs with applesauce (it&#8217;s the classic choice), but apples make my stomach hurt. You generally want to pick a food that doesn&#8217;t give you cramps and is as safe as possible so that it won&#8217;t be confusing discomfort with a potential reaction.</p>&#10;<p>After about 20 minutes of waiting after eating the mixture, the doctor will come in and check on you. For me, we would take my vitals &#8212; blood pressure, oxygen levels, and heart rate. It is important to confirm that your blood pressure is not dropping during this time &#8212; for me, it was going up with the nervousness on my first appointment! The doctor will also ask you if you&#8217;re feeling sick before progressing.</p>&#10;<p>Once you get the all-clear, it&#8217;ll be time for the next dose! In my appointments, we repeated this process 4 times before declaring that it was enough progress to take as my home dose.</p>&#10;<p>When planning for your appointment, it is also important to note that after you take your final dose, you are typically recommended to wait at the doctor&#8217;s office for an extra hour of observation. This is just to be on the cautious side that you won&#8217;t have a reaction after you leave the facility.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What are the signs to pay attention to for a potential reaction?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Of course your doctor will be going over this with you, but I find it helpful sometimes just to be aware of what might happen before a given situation. Some of the main things to look out for are:</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>Stomach cramps</li>&#10;<li>Bloating</li>&#10;<li>Mouth (or throat) itching</li>&#10;<li>Lips tingling</li>&#10;<li>Hives</li>&#10;</ul>&#10;<p>Above is not inclusive of all the reactions you may have during oral immunotherapy.</p>&#10;<p>What&#8217;s important to remember which may help with anxiety is that not all reactions that occur will be anaphylactic. For me, while I experienced some discomfort in later appointments (not the first few), I was able to tackle using medications outside of antihistamine (ex. Pepto Bismol for stomach cramps). I also want to disclose that I had all of the above side effects at some point during my treatment, except for the hives.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What&#8217;s a home dose?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>After your first appointment, your doctor should send you home with enough maintenance doses to take you through to your next appointment. These should already be measured out for you. If they&#8217;re not and you don&#8217;t feel comfortable measuring it out, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask your doctor to do it! For me, they did charge extra for it, but it was worth it for the anxiety. And don&#8217;t forget to contact us at ARFNA if you need assistance with the bills!</p>&#10;<p>The home dose should be equivalent to the last dose you took at the doctor (unless you say you felt uncomfortable with the last dose &#8212; then you will take the highest level you felt safe with). You simply take it the same way you did at the doctor&#8217;s office! Just mix it with whatever you want and make sure to eat all of it. If you feel some stomach discomfort, it is helpful to take it with food.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>What are some tips to be safe with home doses?</strong></h3>&#10;<p>I want to acknowledge that there is a difference in stress levels when you take a dose of an allergen at home versus at the doctor. At least at the doctor&#8217;s office, you know you are surrounded by experts who would know how to handle a worst-case scenario. So, even though you know you successfully took the dose at the doctor&#8217;s office, I understand the additional nerves.</p>&#10;<p>For me, it helped to make sure I understood what are the risk factors to get an allergic reaction during the home dosing stage. After all, at this point in the journey, we would know that our body can tolerate it in the conditions of the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>&#10;<ul>&#10;<li>Do not exercise 1 hour before or 2 hours after your dose</li><ul><li>You do not want to get your heart rate very high and metabolism way up in comparison to the doctor&#8217;s office conditions</li></ul>&#10;<li>Do not take a hot shower around the time you take your dose</li><ul><li>This also may increase your metabolism</li></ul><li><span>Do not eat your dose with food you are not 100% sure is safe</span></li><ul><li>While it helps to eat your dose with food, try to avoid eating your dose with food you are not sure if it is allergen-free. The reason being is sometimes there can be cross contamination &#8212; and while you are able to handle that level of contamination without the dose, it&#8217;s good to recognize that the dose you take is taking you close to your tolerance levels.</li></ul><li><span>Do not consume any alcohol during the time of your dosing</span></li><li>Do not take your normal dose when you are sick</li><ul><li>Talk to your doctor about receiving a &#8220;down dose.&#8221; This is considered a safer dose for when you are sick. When running a fever, for example, your body might respond in different ways than normal. I personally took a down dose when I got sick with the Flu.</li></ul><li><span>Do not go to bed right after taking your dose</span></li><ul><li>While the home dose is safe, you do not want to be in a position where you are sleeping and unable to catch what symptoms your body might be having to your dose. I would recommend waiting at least an or two before falling asleep.</li></ul></ul>&#10;<h3><strong>Overall Experience</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Overall, the beginning of my immunotherapy journey went without hiccups. Around my 3rd appointment, I did start to feel some stomach discomfort, so instead of up-dosing around 4 doses, we would up-dose 1 or 2. This did slow down the process, but I felt safer and far more comfortable when taking the doses. The reason that I started having some discomfort by then was because we had found my initial tolerance level for nuts.</p>&#10;<p>Although this stage is full of nerves, this is generally the easiest part of the immunotherapy journey as the biggest hangup tends to be the anxiety, rather than &#8220;gosh this all tastes disgusting.&#8221;</p>&#10;<p>The goal by the end of the journey is to get to plain nuts, which is the crushed up nuts stage without the cellulose.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow along the journey and see the next article&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">here</a>!</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Read More in the Series&#8230;</strong></h3><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">Overview of Oral Immunotherapy</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy: Part 2 -- Eating Crushed Nuts</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">Graduating Oral Immunotherapy -- Eating Whole Nuts</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/6/9-Strategies-for-Consuming-OIT-Dose"" target=""_blank"">9 Strategies for Consuming Your Oral Immunotherapy Home Dose</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/7/The-Effects-of-Oral-Immunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">The Side Effects and Result of Oral Immunot<font face=""Calibri"">herapy&#160;&#160;</font></a><font face=""Calibri""><br></font></p><p><br></p>"|35ab/3ab/jY9Fqs2CUo0JrZO.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-02-15 04:31:26|2023-02-16 14:08:36
4|Roshnee Sharma|Oral Immunotherapy: Part 2||"<p>This is part of a series! See the part 1 of the oral immunotherapy journey&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/3/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>&#10;<p>The next stage of immunotherapy was eating plain nuts. This is a big milestone! Rather than eating the cellulose/nut mixture, this stage is defined as eating the raw nut itself, just crushed and weighed out.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Journey to Plain Nuts</strong></h3>&#10;<p>My journey to the plain nut stage was fairly uneventful. I did have some issues with anxiety around eating the nuts as the volume I was consuming continued to increase. It doesn&#8217;t help that one symptom of an anaphylactic reaction is a &#8220;sense of impending doom,&#8221; which I felt was quite common throughout the process.</p>&#10;<p>However, after I had moved past my &#8220;threshold&#8221; for nuts during the cellulose/nut stage, we were able to progress much faster towards plain nuts.</p>&#10;<p><font size=""3"">&#128161; <em>A &#8220;threshold&#8221; is defined as the first quantity where your body was likely to react with an anaphylactic reaction to the allergen. It can be a range.</em></font></p>&#10;<p>The plain nut stage felt really great in the beginning. Because I was doing my immunotherapy with 5 different allergens at the same time, to get to 0.5g of each allergen meant I had to have 2.5g of the allergens total. In the cellulose/nut mixture, this was an even larger quantity since 2.5g of the allergen was more like 10g of the diluted mixture. So, when we moved to plain nuts, it was a relief that the quantity that I had to eat was much smaller.</p>&#10;<p>An important thing to note is that, during this stage, the quantity of the allergen that you will be consuming will go up very quickly. Don&#8217;t be surprised and trust your doctor in the research that has been done in immunotherapy. It was alarming for me to see how quickly we went from 1g of each allergen to 5g (it was around 8 up-doses), but things turned out fine. That being said, do not be afraid to talk to your doctor about half-doses, and take only one or two up-doses per session rather than four to five.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Getting the Flavors of Nuts</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Another exciting part of this stage is that you can start to actually smell and taste the flavors of the nuts! For me, it was a little challenging as I started to develop a bit of an aversion to the flavor and the smell given how it was not making me feel very good. But within my mixture, I had included: peanuts, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, and sesame.</p>&#10;<p>At around the 0.5g mark, I started to get some of the flavors of the nuts. It was hard to differentiate because they were all mixed together! But pine nuts tasted extremely herby. I could completely understand why it is an ingredient in pesto. I would also get a little bit of a toasty flavor, which I attributed to the peanuts.</p>&#10;<p>I also felt that as the flavors of the nuts started to become more prominent, I started to mix up how I ate the nuts. For example, my dose included pine nuts, which do not go well with chocolate or vanilla pudding, and was actually quite gross. So I had later pivoted to a citrus flavored greek yogurt (that also was a little healthier and decreased my daily sugar intake!) that would better mask the flavor.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>The Downs</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Getting to this stage definitely had its ups and downs. While it was very exciting to start to eat the nuts and get the new flavors, the quantity that I had to consume was very large, and it was beginning to feel more like a meal in itself rather than a small dose of medicine.</p>&#10;<p>One thing that I did try during this time was to just dump the mixture of nuts into my mouth and swallow it with water. This turned out to be a horrible idea, as I was not used to the bare nut directly touching my mouth. I didn&#8217;t have an anaphylactic reaction, but my lips, tongue, and throat were incredibly itchy. This was when I learned that the progress of a skin/touch reaction can progress differently than a consumption-based reaction. As well, due to the powder sticking in my mouth for longer, it made the discomfort continue. On this day, I had Benadryl at the ready but did not end up having to use it as the symptoms started to subside on their own. It was just very uncomfortable.</p>&#10;<p>Beyond that, after every up-dose appointment with the doctor, I started to be prepared for immense stomach cramps and bloating for the next couple days during my home dosing. It was after this that my doctor and I worked on a plan to increase my dose at a slower rate, because of how unbearable it was getting. But I would get abdominal cramps and intense bloating and would have to lay in bed because it would be so exhausting after eating the nuts. However, this would subside on its own without medicine. If I had to be a functioning human that day, Pepto Bismol would help subside the symptoms faster.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Traveling During Oral Immunotherapy Treatment</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Traveling feels scary, but the first thing I would do is make sure that you are going to a place that is near a hospital. The reality is that you are regularly exposing yourself to an allergen, and while the chances of a reaction are very slim, you do not want to be in a worst case situation. Having said that, I also want to highlight that by this stage of the oral immunotherapy treatment, you have built up more tolerance for the allergen than you did before, which means that eating out is actually safer. Do make sure that when you are taking your dose, you are finding a time to do it that it is not within an hour or two of eating out at a place that you&#8217;re not sure if it is 100% allergen-free.</p>&#10;<p>Since you can&#8217;t bring pudding in a carry-on bag through TSA, I would recommend either checking a bag or stopping by a grocery store on the way. When packing my nuts, I got little 2oz plastic condiment cups (see link here to buy:&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3jYrKbw"" target=""_blank"">https://amzn.to/3jYrKbw</a>) with lids so I could measure out my doses before I travelled. Although the lids were airtight, I did tape the lids to the cup just to make sure that with the pressure during flying wouldn&#8217;t be an issue. Then I packed the cups in Tupperware to make sure that they wouldn&#8217;t be squeezed and pop open. Also if it spilled, it would be contained within that container.</p>&#10;<p>Another thing that I tried was baking my nuts into cookies. This idea sounds better for a smaller dose of peanuts than what I was taking (around 15g of all my nuts per dose). But what I did was make a soft chocolate chip cookie recipe, split the dough into individual servings, and then work the doses into the cookie dough. Then I baked them as normal. The flavor of the pine nuts and sesame was quite strong, so I ended up coating the cookies in tons of frosting to make them taste better. However, depending on your mix of allergens, this could end up being delicious and not overpowering. Baking doses into cookies made it easier to transport though because I could take the cookies in a Ziploc bag and press out the air.</p>&#10;<h3><strong>Overall Experience of Plain Nuts</strong></h3>&#10;<p>Despite it being more challenging, this stage was the last stage before I would be reaching graduation - which would mean that I could eat the whole nut itself, no longer awkwardly mixed into yogurt or pudding. So that kept my hopes up during some of the downs of this stage.</p>&#10;<p>Although this is the most challenging part of the treatment, both mentally and physically, it is the most rewarding. The progress I have made in this stage has allowed me to try so many new foods! For me, I got to try ice cream at an ice cream shop for the first time during this stage since I was getting comfortable with minor cross contamination. It was around the 1g mark that I started to have more treats with &#8220;may contain&#8221; allergen statements on it.</p>&#10;<p>Next article in this series:&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">Graduating Immunotherapy</a></p><p><br></p><h3><b>Read More In The Series...</b><br></h3><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">Overview of Oral Immunotherapy</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/3/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy Part 1 -- Eating Nut &#34;Flour&#34;</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">Graduating Oral Immunotherapy -- Eating Whole Nuts</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/6/9-Strategies-for-Consuming-OIT-Dose"" target=""_blank"">9 Strategies for Consuming Your Oral Immunotherapy Home Dose</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/7/The-Effects-of-Oral-Immunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">The Side Effects and Result of Oral Immunot<font face=""Calibri"">herapy&#160;&#160;</font></a></p><p><br></p><p><font size=""1""><i>Disclaimer: We use Amazon Affiliate links for links to any Amazon page purchases on this blog.

5|Roshnee Sharma|Graduating OIT!||"<p>This article is part of a series! See the previous article&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>&#10;<p>Oral Immunotherapy graduation is the ultimate goal of the entire therapy. This means that you hit a &#8220;bite proof&#8221; stage &#8212; the idea is not that you are not allergic to peanuts (or your allergen) anymore. The idea is that you can be accidentally exposed to your allergen and you should not have an anaphylactic reaction.</p>&#10;<p>&#128161;<i><font size=""3""> I take a bite of a grilled cheese sandwich and I taste an oddly nutty flavor. I can swallow that bite, put the sandwich down, and not eat the rest of it. I will not have an allergic reaction. A situation like this can save lives at restaurants, where they can often make mistakes when preparing your food.</font></i></p>&#10;<p>I want to highlight that there is some research that shows IgE levels dropping after two to three years of consistently exposing yourself to an allergen. The level drop is shown in bloodwork, but I don&#8217;t personally think this means that three years after graduation, you no longer have an allergy. There is still more research to be done in this field to understand the impact of oral immunotherapy in the long term, including what happens if you miss your daily dose.</p>&#10;<p>&#128161;<i><font size=""3""> High amounts of IgE in blood are typically associated with anaphylactic allergic reactions to food.</font></i></p>&#10;<h3><b><font size=""3"">Taking my daily dose</font></b></h3>&#10;<p>In my immunotherapy journey, graduation was defined as me being able to eat 4g of each of the nuts I was allergic too. In practice, this should protect me when exposed to up to 5g of my allergen. Another hallmark of the immunotherapy graduation is that I would move from eating &#8220;plain nuts&#8221; to &#8220;whole nuts.&#8221; In other words, this meant that I could eat an entire peanut in isolation, rather than the oddly flavored mix I had been consuming in yoghurt. This meant that I had to go to the store and buy some nuts!</p>&#10;<p>Having gone most of my life scowling at the peanut aisle and its mere existence, it was a crazy experience to walk into the aisle and pick up a bag of peanuts. For me, most of the nuts were easy to find, except for sesame seeds (which is not a nut, just many people who are allergic to peanuts tend to have a sesame allergy too, but we&#8217;re not sure why). Since I needed to buy the seeds in large quantities to be economical ($10 for 28g (1oz) of sesame seeds is not practical), I did order online&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3YSeQug"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>&#10;<p>Another interesting part of the immunotherapy is that you can now safely handle cross contamination of your allergen. This also means that when you&#8217;re buying a bag of pecans, for example, it doesn&#8217;t matter that it may contain peanuts. This greatly improves your chances of finding nuts that you need at a regular supermarket.</p>&#10;<p>Along with my nuts, I also needed some way to practically measure out 4g of nuts. Since it was still so soon after graduation (the same day!), I needed to be extra careful about my measurements. I bought these 2oz plastic salad dressing containers (<a href=""https://amzn.to/3EcuHvE"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>), and this jewelry scale (<a href=""https://amzn.to/40XOCIB"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>) with these calibration weights (<a href=""https://amzn.to/3XJcQUo"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>). This made it possible for me to measure out my nuts in order to eat them.</p>&#10;<p>This was a really big moment to get to try all of these new nuts, and I tried the peanut first. I hated it. I&#8217;ve written a blog here (<i>link to come! This is a pre-truth</i>) about the different flavors of nuts, but to me, peanuts tasted like everything I had been avoiding. And the smell was awful. It would also get stuck in my teeth, which meant that my tongue would be exposed to the peanut for longer than usual. When that happened, it would make my tongue and mouth feel really tingly.</p>&#10;<p>For the sesame seeds, I wasn&#8217;t really sure how to take them, so I ended up baking some Italian sesame cookies, using a technique of portioning my dough and then rolling it into 4g of sesame seeds. The flavor of the cookies was interesting, but it grew on me. People don&#8217;t say &#8220;a cookie a day keeps the doctors away&#8221; though; this wasn&#8217;t sustainable. I later realized that I could take a bit of the sesame seeds  almost like a bunch of tiny pills - I would take a few (around a gram) and swallow it with water. I repeat this until I complete my full dose of seeds.</p>&#10;<p>This mouth and lips tingling didn&#8217;t stop until after two weeks. Now I don&#8217;t feel anything when I take my daily dose. I used to take my nuts with a piece of chocolate afterwards as my &#8220;chaser&#8221; to get rid of the flavor, but now I found that eating my lunch directly after taking the nuts is a much more pleasant experience, and it settles my stomach as well.</p>&#10;<p>At the time of writing, it has been about two months since I graduated immunotherapy. When I was first starting my daily dose, I was extremely strict with my 4g measurement &#8212; this meant that I would break a nut into as many tiny pieces as I needed to to hit this number. As I started to feel more comfortable with my nut doses (around a month in I stopped getting gas and itchiness), I slowly increased the range I would allow myself to take. I still make sure to hit the 4g threshold that my allergist recommended, but now I can go up to 0.5g higher than that if that&#8217;s what the nuts dictate.</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Buying Flavored Nuts</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>These are GAME CHANGERS! This is why it gets its own section. Nuts on their own do not taste very good. They don&#8217;t have much flavor, and if you associate it with a hospital trip, it doesn&#8217;t really help the situation.</p>&#10;<p>For my peanuts, I bought a&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3YRSw3Y"" target=""_blank"">honey roasted flavor</a>&#160;which definitely hides the toasty and overwhelmingly peanutty flavor of the normal peanut. I am hoping to play around with more flavors. Since pecans are slightly bitter on the inside, I bought&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3xsAn0U"" target=""_blank"">vanilla-bourbon flavored ones</a>. I actually look forward to eating these! I also bought some snacking walnuts which come with a variety of flavors as well (<a href=""https://amzn.to/3YMd5yO"" target=""_blank"">hot honey</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/40Vek0B"" target=""_blank"">salted dark chocolate</a>). I think it&#8217;s important when taking your daily dose to remember that most people don&#8217;t eat all nuts plain. It&#8217;s okay to look into flavors after graduation to make for a more pleasurable experience.</p>&#10;<p>If you can&#8217;t find flavored nuts, I would recommend candying or seasoning them yourself to switch things up.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Where do we go from here?</b></h3>&#10;<p>After graduating from the oral immunotherapy treatment, the world of foods has opened up.  I tried a single peanut m&amp;m. I recently bought the drumsticks ice cream cones that weren&#8217;t dipped in peanuts. I tried ramen, which typically uses sesame oil in cooking some of the meats and eggs. I feel safe to travel internationally because a restaurant doesn&#8217;t need to be familiar with the severity of nut allergies, but just the ingredients that they are adding into the food itself. I feel like I can try so many more cuisines and restaurants spontaneously, rather than needing to call ahead and do extensive research.</p>&#10;<p>So while I&#8217;m not going out of my way to eat my allergens, I am greatly enjoying the perks and flexibility that not having a severe anaphylactic allergy entails of. I feel so fortunate that I can be so grateful for the freedom that I do have, because I know what it was like to live with the constant restrictions.</p>&#10;<p>My allergist and I have spoken about a future where I could get to a free-eating stage if I feel that I am not having an aversion to the nuts and want to progress. I am planning on following through on that offer. For me, this would be in February 2023, three months after my graduation date. Free-eating would consist of increasing my threshold to 10g or 20g of peanut, thereby allowing me to eat a dish that actually had peanuts in it.</p>&#10;<p>While I am still not sure if I&#8217;m ever going to go out of my way to eat pad thai that&#8217;s topped with peanuts, knowing that I could would give me even more peace of mind.</p>&#10;<p>Overall, I have been really happy with my oral immunotherapy journey. The comfort that it has provided me is completely life-changing, and I want anybody is going through a severe allergy to strongly consider going through a treatment that could bring so much calmness. I think that there is so much fear around this therapy because of the risks of anaphylaxis, but the more research I did, and having gone through it, I realize that a lot of the risks can be mitigated, and the risk of any allergic reaction continues to decrease as you continue the treatment. My doctor, Dr. Jon Welch from <a href=""https://olympiaallergy.com/"">Olympia Allergy and Immunology</a>, had a 98% success rate to graduation, and highlighted that the people who dropped didn&#8217;t drop due to anaphylaxis. It&#8217;s the side effects and the aversion that makes people not want to continue. I understand it.</p>&#10;<p>I hope that the Oral Immunotherapy series was helpful in seeing one person&#8217;s experience through the journey. If you or your child has gone through a treatment experience, feel free to write an article and share it! I think that the more visibility we have about the treatments people have had, the more we can educate ourselves on what would be best for our lifestyle.</p><h3><b>Read More In The Series...</b><br></h3><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">Overview of Oral Immunotherapy</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/3/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy Part 1 -- Eating Nut &#34;Flour&#34;</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy: Part 2 -- Eating Crushed Nuts</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/6/9-Strategies-for-Consuming-OIT-Dose"" target=""_blank"">9 Strategies for Consuming Your Oral Immunotherapy Home Dose</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/7/The-Effects-of-Oral-Immunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">The Side Effects and Result of Oral Immunot<font face=""Calibri"">herapy&#160;&#160;</font></a></p><p><br></p><p><font size=""1""><i>Disclaimer: We use Amazon Affiliate links for links to any Amazon page purchases on this blog.

6|Roshnee Sharma|9 Strategies for Consuming OIT Dose||"<p>This article is part of a series! Read the previous article&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">here</a></p>&#10;<p>In the beginning of my oral immunotherapy journey, my doses consisted of crushed nuts mixed with cellulose. It was a white powder that didn&#8217;t taste or smell like nuts. I would mix that with a tablespoon of chocolate pudding until it dissolved, then I would eat it.</p>&#10;<p>And this strategy was <em>fantastic</em>, until I started to move forward in the journey. Soon, the amount I was consuming would no longer dissolve into a tablespoon of chocolate pudding. Beyond that, when I moved to stage 2 of the therapy (read about it&#160;<a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">here</a>!), I started to eat crushed nuts. The nature of my therapy was that I got a weird mixture of herbs and toastiness mixed into chocolate pudding, given that I was working on an allergy to 5 different nuts at the same time. To dissolve the nuts, I was eating an entire pudding cup (sometimes more&#8230;)</p>&#10;<p>During an oral immunotherapy treatment, I was recommended to take the nuts at the same time everyday to minimize the risk of a reaction. However, the increased amount of sugar and the horrible taste of the nuts would make me gag and procrastinate taking my daily dose. I didn&#8217;t want to take it because it would make me feel sick and it tasted awful. I knew that I needed to find a better plan for taking my dose.</p>&#10;<p>Below are some of the strategies that I used to combat the taste of the nuts, as well as add some variety to my daily dose. Feel free to use this as inspiration for taking your own dose!</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Bulk Measure Your Doses</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>I highly recommend using little salad dressing cups (<a href=""https://amzn.to/3Yx4Fvo"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>) in order to make taking your dose easier. The doses would make me feel a little ill, so having to measure them before each day was an extra step that made me procrastinate taking my doses, just because I didn&#8217;t want to do work to make me sick!</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Take Dose With Water</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>&#128161; <i>Skin and consumption food allergy reactions can progress at different rates!</i></p>&#10;<p>One thing I want to highlight is that skin reactions and consumption reactions can progress at different rates. As I started to progress to the plain nut stage, I found that the nuts could stay in my mouth for longer than I was used to, which would then lead to an unbearable amount of scratchiness. Taking it with water and swishing it around in my mouth really helped prevent the symptoms before it got too bad.</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Consume Dose Before a Meal</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>This is a big one. My stomach would really hurt after I would eat my dose, which made things very difficult. On top of that, my mouth would get pretty scratchy, even when taking my dose with ample water. Having a meal would really help settle my stomach and clear out my mouth.</p>&#10;<p>If a meal is not possible, I would still recommend a snack you know is 100% safe to eat afterwards. For me, I would eat some&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3k1cj22"" target=""_blank"">nut free chocolates</a>&#160;or homemade caramel. Something thick and creamy can help alleviate the discomfort in the mouth. I would still recommend a piece of toast or chips to help settle the stomach.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Use a Textured Pudding</b></h3>&#10;<p>For me, it started to get weird when the nuts would create clumps and ruin the smooth texture of chocolate pudding. To combat the weird lumps, I transitioned to using a vanilla rice pudding. While the flavor didn&#8217;t do much for masking or enhancing the flavor of the mixture, the texture was no longer confusing, because I couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between the rice and the &#8220;nut globs.&#8221;</p>&#10;<p>This was the rice pudding I used since I was too lazy to make my own:&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3k5SerC"" target=""_blank"">Rice Pudding</a></p>&#10;<h3><b>Use a Rich and Creamy Pudding</b></h3>&#10;<p>The high fat content of a rich, homemade pudding can actually alleviate some of the mouth itchiness. The fats can help create a little layer that makes the soothes the inside of the cheeks and tongue. For me, I made an egg-rich butterscotch pudding, as well as ice cream with a custard base. The coolness of the ice cream can also help calm the irritation.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Use a Tangy Flavor to Mask Dose</b></h3>&#10;<p>For me, the flavor of the nuts was absolutely not my favorite, especially when mixed with chocolate pudding. Using a technique that&#8217;s typically used to mask bitter medicine flavors, I tried out a&#160;<a href=""https://amzn.to/3KcqaNG"" target=""_blank"">lemon pudding</a>. This actually helped immensely because the lemon was so overpowering in comparison with the nuts that I could no longer taste them.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Mix Nuts Into Oatmeal</b></h3>&#10;<p>This strategy is almost a composite strategy between the texture, creaminess, and a meal. I added plenty of brown sugar and cinnamon to a bowl of oatmeal mixed with my dose, as well as some berries to add some tartness. This combo would hide the texture of the nuts. The taste was still a little weird, but this might be because I had some strong flavors with the pine nuts and sesame seeds which don&#8217;t typically go into oatmeal. This strategy can also be challenging because I need to make sure I consume the full bowl of oatmeal to guarantee that I ate my full dose.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Mix Nuts Into Tomato Sauce</b></h3>&#10;<p>This played well into the fact that my mixture had pine nuts in it, which pairs well with savory foods. By boiling some pasta and making marinara sauce, I could reserve enough sauce for one plate of pasta and mix my dose into that. This masked the flavor pretty well, although I was a little thrown off with the texture.</p>&#10;<h3><b>Bake Nuts into Cookies</b></h3>&#10;<p>I personally think this strategy works better without pine nuts or sesame seeds, but this was something I tried to make my nuts more transportable. I followed a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe, and portioned the dough into individual cookies. Then I took a piece of dough and kneaded my dose (or half my dose) into each cookie. This allowed me to be super precise to guarantee that each cookie had the same amount of nuts, keeping it safe for the treatment. Then I baked the cookies as usual.</p>&#10;<p>For me, I did end up buying some store bought frosting and slathered it generously over the cookie since the sesame-herbal flavor was still throwing me off. However, I would highly recommend this if the nuts during your therapy are classically used in desserts (ex. pecans, walnuts, almonds etc&#8230;)</p>&#10;<p>When using this strategy, don&#8217;t hesitate to make the cookies bigger than you usually do, so it hides the nuts better. Treat yourself.</p><p><br></p>&#10;<p>I want to highlight that because of all the allergens I was working on, this meant that my dose was reaching 20g of a crushed nut mixture, to ensure that I had 4g of each of my allergens. So some of my difficulties relating to texture and quantity might be trivial for someone doing oral immunotherapy with just 1 or 2 nuts.</p>&#10;<p>If you&#8217;re reading this and have used some strategies for taking your OIT dose, please share with the community! I think it&#8217;s so important, because I was personally really struggling to find practical tips that I could use for inspiration. I ended up reading articles about how to help old people take their medicinal pills by crushing them. This isn&#8217;t really comparable quantity or flavor wise with oral immunotherapy.</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Read More In The Series...</b><br></h3><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">Overview of Oral Immunotherapy</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/3/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy Part 1 -- Eating Nut &#34;Flour&#34;</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy: Part 2 -- Eating Crushed Nuts</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">Graduating Oral Immunotherapy -- Eating Whole Nuts</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/7/The-Effects-of-Oral-Immunotherapy"" target=""_blank"">The Side Effects and Result of Oral Immunot<font face=""Calibri"">herapy&#160;&#160;</font></a><br></p><p><br></p><p><font size=""1""><i>Disclaimer: We use Amazon Affiliate links for links to any Amazon page purchases on this blog.

7|Roshnee Sharma|The Effects of Oral Immunotherapy||"<p>I wanted to make this post to highlight a little more about life experiences before, during, and after the immunotherapy experience. I think it&#8217;s important to have a comparison as well as understand the side effects that pop up as part of immunotherapy.</p>&#10;<h3><b><font size=""4"">Before</font></b></h3>&#10;<p>A day with my allergy would result in a lot of daily anxiety. When I would go into work, I would disinfect my desk to make sure that my skin wouldn&#8217;t break out. I would watch what everyone was eating very closely so I could be aware if someone had consumed nuts to make sure that I avoided them or requested they washed their hands so I wouldn&#8217;t get additional hives. By the time lunch would come around, I needed to give all restaurant recommendations because I knew what was safe for my allergy. Oftentimes, this led me to be limited to Italian and Mexican cuisine. And this is just a good case of people around me being supportive!</p>&#10;<p>When I was in school, I struggled with isolation and bullying &#8212; people would think I was overreacting to my allergy. I wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to stay over at a friend&#8217;s house because there was no guarantee of the safety of the food, or if I would come across nuts by accident.</p>&#10;<p>As a safety mechanism for myself, I started to recognize when I was in a room where nuts were around. The smell would be an instant turnoff. I became extremely good at researching brands and knowing what the allergen statements were on a variety of popular foods. I also got good at subtly reading the ingredients label that was on the food people around me were eating.</p>&#10;<p>Flying &#8212; forget it. I always boarded early to make sure I could disinfect my seat. I would bring extra nut safe snacks for the passengers around me in case the plane couldn&#8217;t accommodate. And when arriving at the destination, I would need to make sure that we had plans of where to go to eat, which grocery store to stop by, and tabs on where the nearest hospital was in case anything happened.</p>&#10;<p>My whole life was completely centered around avoidance. It&#8217;s absolutely the right thing to do with a severe allergy, but that amount of anxiety and obsessiveness is enough to drive anyone crazy! But it&#8217;s also important to understand how internalized my fear of nuts were.</p>&#10;<h3><b><font size=""4"">During</font></b></h3>&#10;<p>Suddenly, when we get to oral immunotherapy, the focus on avoiding nuts is thrown out the window. Instead, we now focus on the exposure. It&#8217;s incredibly counterintuitive. For me, the smell of nuts itself would make me terrified &#8212; after all, I had spent my entire life avoiding them and leaving rooms if I was too close to nuts! My talent was to avoid my allergen, and now, we were going to tackle it face on.</p>&#10;<p>I really want to highlight that anxiety is a huge reason that people drop out of immunotherapy. It is not only the actual reaction - which is less common than you would expect. Instead, it is the lifelong mental aversion to nuts that patients have to combat. My very first dose was incredibly difficult to swallow. I felt that I was doing something stupid and putting my life in danger for a spoonful of pudding. When I got to plain nuts, I could smell the nuts, and this made me so nauseous. I didn&#8217;t even want to mix everything because it was so frustrating to be around it.</p>&#10;<p>As a timeline, my treatment time lasted around 6 months.</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Overcoming the Fear of Exposure</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>It was very difficult to trust the doctors, but knowing that there was a hospital nearby and the nurses were on standby was comforting. I also took comfort in knowing that I was not the first person who had ever undergone this treatment before. Another thing I really focused on was the bright side of overcoming an allergy. I would think about all the foods that I could eat, and really dream.</p>&#10;<p>My strategy was a mixture of hope and faith. I had to believe in the process, and I had to remember what I was doing this for. There were multiple times throughout the treatment that I would forget it was worth it, but remembering that I would no longer be the problem when people wanted to eat at a certain place kept me going. Knowing that my partner would be able to eat anything he wanted instead of him needing to be in constant avoidance kept me going.</p>&#10;<p>Honestly, of all treatments in the world, this is the most fun because as you continue to progress through the levels, you are consistently building your tolerance and can see the progress. It&#8217;s just about swallowing that first dose, and when it turns out okay, you continue to build confidence.</p>&#10;<h3><font size=""3""><b>Physical Side Effects</b></font></h3>&#10;<p>I did handle more side effects than just mental aversion. Anytime I would updose my nuts, I started to get the side effects again for a couple days until the next appointment. These stopped  after I hit the maintenance (or whole nut) stage.</p>&#10;<p>I would get incredibly gassy and bloated after eating the nuts, and this would lead to enormous <strong>stomach cramps</strong>. These could be alleviated with Pepto Bismol (my new best friend), but it would still be very uncomfortable for some time.</p>&#10;<p>I would feel a lot of <strong>fatigue</strong> after eating the nuts as well. I think it was because my body was being forced to digest a food it didn&#8217;t know how to. So it would take an immense amount of energy. Even though I would feel physically full, I felt exhausted, and I would need to lay down in bed for a couple hours after taking my dose. This didn&#8217;t happen every time, but definitely the first or second home dose after my appointment, I would not be feeling my best.</p>&#10;<p>As I started to progress to higher stages of the immunotherapy, I would also start to feel a lot of discomfort in my mouth. My throat and tongue would feel very <strong>scratchy</strong>. This doesn&#8217;t happen to everyone, it depends on what stage your touch allergy was and how fast you progress, but for me, the touch allergy was very sensitive and progressed very slowly. So even though I could eat the nuts, I would feel very sick and try to eat cold foods to soothe it.</p>&#10;<p>There was also a lot of pressure to stay still after I took my dose. Although I was allowed to walk and do low impact movements, to reduce the risk of anaphylaxis, it is recommended that you do not do exercise or take hot showers. Given how uncomfortable I would feel and how uncomfortably full I would feel, not being able to move to help speed things along was very frustrating.</p>&#10;<h3><b><font size=""4"">After</font></b></h3>&#10;<p>I do want to highlight that I am sharing the side effects that I experienced for transparency purposes. Today, I am greatly enjoying how life feels after oral immunotherapy, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience less anxiety around their allergy.</p>&#10;<p>I am not going to say that I am no longer allergic to nuts. Until I hit free eating stages where I don&#8217;t have to think about the quantity of nuts in my food, I think that the allergy is still there. It just feels <em>so much less severe</em> than it used to feel. I know that I have room for a mistake. I can take a bite of food at a restaurant, and recognize that it has nuts and stop. It&#8217;s not an instant trip to the hospital.</p>&#10;<p>Although I still pre-board on planes because of the touch allergy, I no longer have to pack ample snacks for the passengers around me so they don&#8217;t feel upset that I am burdening them with the lack of food choices (of course I wasn&#8217;t! But it did feel that way).</p>&#10;<p>When I went to the office, I was able to try the cornbread that someone had left in the kitchen - even though I didn&#8217;t have an ingredient label. When we got a catered lunch from Panera Bread, I was able to eat it, as well as enjoy the chocolate chip cookie afterwards. No one really knows me as &#8220;the one with the allergy.&#8221;</p>&#10;<p>People around me can eat peanut butter stuffed pretzels and peanut m&amp;ms, and it&#8217;s not the end of the world! I did try very tiny quantities of them. I think it&#8217;s an acquired taste, but I can&#8217;t nearly eat enough of it to acquire it at this stage.</p>&#10;<p>I have been able to try new food cuisines. I&#8217;m able to go to Indian restaurants, and I tried Ramen for the first time! I have gotten a slice of cake at a random bakery after having a meal. When I eat dessert, I can rank them, rather than simply appreciate them all since it&#8217;s such a rarity.</p>&#10;<p>I am also excited about international travel. I was never able to do it without packing tons of canned foods that I knew were 100% safe, since in some countries with less prevalence of food allergies, it can be difficult to explain the severity in cases of cross contamination. But now that I can handle foods that simply don&#8217;t contain the ingredient, it becomes so much easier to explain. I can&#8217;t wait to explore the world, it&#8217;s a door that never fully felt open to me before.</p>&#10;<p>I honestly feel like I have so many more opportunities to enjoy more parts of life than before. I am grateful of all the new experiences that I can have because of this treatment, because it really has been life-changing. My anxiety around food has become less, so I&#8217;m pretty sure on top of saving me from an accidental exposure, I&#8217;ve also added a couple years to my life.</p>&#10;<p>I hope that this post was helpful in figuring out how life can change with oral immunotherapy, as well as some of the things to expect if you do choose to undergo the treatment!</p><p><br></p><h3><b>Read More In The Series...</b><br></h3><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/2/Oral-Immunotherapy-%28OIT%29"" target=""_blank"">Overview of Oral Immunotherapy</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/3/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-1"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy Part 1 -- Eating Nut &#34;Flour&#34;</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/4/Oral-Immunotherapy:-Part-2"" target=""_blank"">Oral Immunotherapy: Part 2 -- Eating Crushed Nuts</a><br></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/5/Graduating-OIT!"" target=""_blank"">Graduating Oral Immunotherapy -- Eating Whole Nuts</a></p><p><a href=""https://arfna.org/blog/6/9-Strategies-for-Consuming-OIT-Dose"" target=""_blank"">9 Strategies for Consuming Your Oral Immunotherapy Home Dose</a></p><p><br></p>"|35ab/7ab/DvMJX7bKIbtlzwf.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-02-15 05:44:25|2023-02-16 14:36:33

9|Roshnee Sharma|What Nuts Taste Like||<h1></h1><p>When I couldn&#8217;t eat nuts, I tried asking everyone that I ever knew if they could describe to me what they tasted like. This was really difficult for people, as they often said that they tasted &#8220;nutty&#8221; (highly unhelpful), or that they were simply texture.</p><p>However, once I started going through the oral challenges for me to try tree nuts (see the previous post here), I found that they tasted completely different than I thought, and that they taste completely different in their toasted and raw counterparts. So I wanted to make this article to go over some of the details on what the nuts tasted like, from the perspective of someone who tried them for the first time when they were 23.</p><h3>Almonds</h3><p>The texture of an almond is pretty crunchy. I was always curious about the brown skin of the almond, but it doesn&#8217;t really have much flavor or texture. It&#8217;s just kind of there, and it can fall off and get stuck in your teeth.</p><p>To be honest, it&#8217;s a little weird because it has the texture of a potato chip, but a fruity and sweet (ish) after taste. Given the texture I typically have with fruits (juicy, fresh), almonds are dry and sweet. When it&#8217;s toasted, it&#8217;s definitely not as sweet, and when salted it becomes more like a plain potato chip with a slightly heartier aftertaste.</p><p>Macarons are typically made of almond flour, and if you were curious about that, they taste very sweet, and primarily like a meringue with frosting on it.</p><h3>Cashews</h3><p>Compared to an almond, a cashew is much softer. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not soft, but it&#8217;s almost a little buttery. It is also incredibly sweet. The sweetness is once again a very natural fruity sweetness.</p><p>When it&#8217;s toasted, it develops a roasty flavor, adding a little bit of balance and depth to the beginning part of the flavor profile of the nut.</p><h3>Pistachios</h3><p>Pistachios are small and green, and have a surprisingly strong flavor profile. It&#8217;s hard to describe, but it&#8217;s almost a little spicy. I would probably say the closest spice to pistachio is saffron, but it&#8217;s less strong. In ice cream, it gives a little more of a forward, sharp flavor in comparison to the soft, creamy, and mellow flavor of cream.</p><p>When toasted, the spicy flavor of the pistachios dulls.</p><h3>Macadamias</h3><p>Macadamias are by far the most interesting nut, in my point of view. It&#8217;s ridiculously soft and buttery. It&#8217;s not soft like a soft-baked cookie, rather, instead of being able to crush into a lot of crumbs, it kind of holds together a little more. The texture is akin to evaporated milk, where it tastes fattier than milk when, in reality, it&#8217;s a similar profile.</p><p>The flavor of a macadamia nut is very mild, it doesn&#8217;t really taste like much. I think it&#8217;s the rich texture of the macadamia that sells it. Honestly, the mouth feel is a little like oil, but more pleasant and it doesn&#8217;t coat your mouth afterwards.</p><p>Because of its mild but rich mouthfeel, it does pair really well with white chocolate&#8217;s bright and sweet flavors.</p><h3>Brazil Nuts</h3><p>Brazil nuts are kind of like almond&#8217;s more sustainable cousin. It&#8217;s firmer than an almond and not as sweet. Instead, it has a slightly bitter undertone to it. Overall, it&#8217;s a nut that&#8217;s fun to eat on its own for the texture, and the flavor is mild and inoffensive.</p><h3>Hazelnuts</h3><p>Hazelnuts are by far the most interesting nut I tried. Texture-wise, it is a very firm nut. The brown skin on top of the hazelnut is similar to the almond in that it falls off easily and doesn&#8217;t taste like much.</p><p>When raw, hazelnuts have a pretty mild profile, but the main profile is a little bitter. It doesn&#8217;t have the same fruitiness of an almond or a cashew.</p><p>However, when toasted, hazelnuts take on a new profile where the bitterness transforms into toastiness. It&#8217;s a little like a gently toasted marshmallow, where it&#8217;s not quite bitter, but not really sweet. It&#8217;s neutral and very pleasant. The texture becomes even firmer (if it was possible), and holds up really well in baked goods and chocolate.</p><p>Because of its mild but toasty flavor, and firm texture, it really pairs well in chocolate because it complements the roasted cocoa bean flavor in chocolate. It adds so much depth to the chocolate, where it&#8217;s almost imperceptible on what is causing the depth, but it tastes significantly different. The texture adds crunch, and it makes a richer crunch compared to puffed rice in chocolate.</p><h3>Pecans</h3><p>Pecans are not one of my favorite nuts on their own. They are almost acidic and bitter. It does have a tiny amount of sweetness at the end, but it&#8217;s not much, and not as forward as the cashew or the almond.</p><p>However, when toasted, that sweetness definitely becomes more pronounced. I still wouldn&#8217;t classify it as sweet, but the acidity definitely disappears. It does pair wonderfully well then with sweet flavors as the pecan ads depth to the sweetness of the seasoning.</p><h3>Walnuts</h3><p>I consider walnuts as a heartier pecan. It&#8217;s more acidic and still has the bitterness, and it doesn&#8217;t have as much sweetness (if any). When toasted, the acidity comes down, but not entirely. However, its flavor becomes so mild when being toasted that it becomes more about the texture of the walnut, which then lends itself well to salads.</p><p>As a snacking nut, it works well with both sweet and spicy flavors, but in my opinion, I think savory and &#8220;hotter&#8221; seasonings really benefit from the added acidity and crunch of the walnut.</p><h3>Pine Nuts</h3><p>Pine nuts are also an incredibly interesting nut. They are similar in softness to the cashew, except that they have a slightly crispier shell (not by much, but it is distinct). It has a soft herby flavor, almost like basil. I understand why it plays well in basil pesto. Honestly, imagine basils in slightly crisp form, and dried, and that is a pine nut.</p><h3>Peanuts</h3><p>These are hard to describe because when I ate them, I really didn&#8217;t enjoy it. Peanuts have an overwhelmingly roasty flavor that I think you need to eat and be exposed to a lot to get used to it.</p><p>Overall, the peanut does not taste like much, but it tastes very &#8220;roasted.&#8221; It&#8217;s smoky. Think of the flavor of the dried, roasted, sea salt seasoning chickpeas you can buy (see here), and amplify the toasty savoriness by 10, and you get the peanut.</p><p>I can see it pairing with chocolate, but it&#8217;s not the same &#8220;complement&#8221; that a hazelnut has. Rather, peanuts bring their own flavor profile to the mix and you can distinctly tell it apart from the chocolate notes. However, the juxtaposition of both creates the appeal (in my opinion). For peanut butter &amp; jelly, it&#8217;s the same thing &#8212; the sweetness complements the roastedness.</p>|35ab/9ab/Jg3HjCrVQ5pNc4l.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-03-29 19:20:00|2023-04-21 04:34:52

Prior to treatment, Caroline was like many of the kids that make the news &#8211; extremely allergic to many different foods.&#160; She had anaphylactic allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, soy, flax, sesame, sunflower seeds.&#160; Our lives revolved around keeping her safe.&#160; My husband and I ensured that our home was an allergen-free place for Caroline, but when we inevitably left our home, we were filled with anxiety.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Anxiety has plagued me my whole life, and often I could listen to assurances from others when they would tell me I was blowing things out of proportion or that things would be ok.&#160; However, for once, it felt like my high anxiety level was appropriate for Caroline&#8217;s level of risk in everyday life.&#160; How could I relax when my precious child was not safe in the world and was a breath away from anaphylaxis at all times?&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>The most daunting part was knowing that the time where I could control Caroline&#8217;s environment and protect her was limited.&#160; Her future, where she would be out in the world without me to read every label and wipe every surface, got closer with each passing day.&#160; Like every parent, you want to give your child what you had and more.&#160; Caroline rolled over at 8 weeks, walked at 9 months, and was talking up a storm before two.&#160; I couldn&#8217;t bear the thought that my vibrant, feisty child would not be able live a life with the freedom that I had enjoyed.&#160; She would have to temper her ambition for life with fear that she might encounter an allergen every step of the way.&#160; And she always had to remain vigilant and could never take a day off.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Even though our allergist at the time offered no solutions and I didn&#8217;t think a cure existed, I knew that I had to do everything within my power to try to make things better.&#160; To that end we tried some alternative and unlikely solutions, including:&#160; exclusively feeding Caroline food from a modified version of the GAPS (&#8220;Gut and Psychology Syndrome&#8221;) diet for two years; paying an &#8220;applied kinesiologist&#8221; to test her allergies while I was breastfeeding; saw a homeopathic doctor in Portland and administered various homeopathic drops from testing her palm with a device; and paying a naturopath in town and trying several supplements.&#160; None of these methods were effective or got us any closer to making Caroline safe, but we held out hope that one day we would find an answer.</span></p><h2><span><b>Finding OIT</b></span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span>One evening when Caroline was three years old, I was googling about food allergy solutions and I came upon a woman&#8217;s website where she discussed her child&#8217;s experience with Oral Immunotherapy for a peanut allergy.&#160; This was the first time I had ever heard this term or that there was any therapy for desensitizing food allergies.&#160; Her website included a list of all of the states and practitioners of Oral Immunotherapy in each state.&#160; I was surprised to find under &#8220;Washington&#8221; that there was a doctor&#8217;s office listed that was located in Bellevue, an hour and a half from my house.&#160; I remember calling the next day and asking &#8220;is this real?&#8221;&#160; To my surprise, the nurse said not only is this real, but it works.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>I made an appointment for us to go meet the doctor, although I was hesitant about whether this was safe or even feasible.&#160; At this point, I thought that maybe this therapy was only for peanuts, or that we may have to make weekly trips to Bellevue for years.&#160; I had another infant daughter at this point and the thought of driving two kids to Bellevue 52 weeks of the year for years seemed a little undoable.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>We were relieved when we met Dr. Welch.&#160; He told us that the nut and seed therapy could be combined and would only take 12 appointments.&#160; He said that Caroline could also be desensitized to soy, but it would be a separate process of around 8-10 appointments.&#160; He did a skin test, clearly demonstrating her severe allergies to so many foods.&#160; For the first time, she had a blood test and we awaited the results to know our next step.&#160;&#160;</span></p><h3><span>Accidental Exposure</span></h3><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>I had a rule to never let Caroline eat food prepared by anyone else, no matter what it was.&#160; This was to relieve others of any responsibility of knowing her many allergens and reduce the likelihood of a reaction.&#160; However, a couple of weeks prior, Caroline&#8217;s friends were eating pea pods and carrots at the park and I could already see how Caroline felt different and left out to not eat with her friends.&#160; So, I decided to allow Caroline to eat pea pods from her friends occasionally.&#160; On Valentine&#8217;s Day of 2018, I had taken Caroline and my infant to a kindergym class and we went to the park afterwards.&#160; Her friends were eating pea pods and so she started eating some as well.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Another friend opened a container of green edamame and Caroline reached for a handful.&#160; I immediately grabbed Caroline&#8217;s hand, emptied it and used a baby wipe to wipe her hand.&#160; Caroline had tested positive for a soy allergy during a skin test, but she had never been exposed.&#160; I had never mentioned that Caroline was allergic to soy and it was completely inadvertent that the edamame was there.&#160; I felt relieved that I had intervened and thought we were out of the woods.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>After playing at the playground for a while, we walked back to the car.&#160; Caroline started sucking her thumb on the way and then began to whimper and whine.&#160; I looked at her and her bottom lip had swollen to twice its normal size.&#160; We had made it to the car, I buckled my infant into her car seat, and then sat with Caroline on my lap and gave her the EpiPen, trying to keep it in place for 10 seconds.&#160; She screamed and squirmed so much so that she created a gash at the injection site.&#160; I called 911 and my husband, who both appeared within minutes.&#160; I was so grateful that the swelling reduced over time and that Caroline did not suffer any other reactions from the exposure.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Later that afternoon, I called Dr. Welch because we still had not received the results from Caroline&#8217;s blood test.&#160; He came on the line and said that her IGE blood levels were sky high.&#160; On a scale of 1-100, Cashew, Brazil nut, Sunflower seed, and Pistachio were over 100. He also said that Caroline was allergic to two specific components of the peanut that indicated an increased likelihood of anaphylaxis.&#160; Soy was positive and high as well, but the IGE level was only 28.&#160; I asked Dr. Welch whether these results meant that it would be unsafe for Caroline to be in OIT.&#160; However, he said the opposite was true.&#160; He said that because Caroline&#8217;s levels were so severe, she was exactly the person that needed to be treated for her allergies.&#160; We were scheduled to begin her therapy in March.&#160; I thanked him and hung up the phone.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span></span></span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>As soon as I hung up, I immediately began to sob from the day&#8217;s events.&#160; I could not believe that my sweet baby had such scary allergies.&#160; I thought that if her soy reaction was so extreme that day, and her IGE level was only 28, what if she was ever exposed to those tree nuts?&#160; The realization that she could have died or could easily die from a morsel of so many foods washed over me.&#160; Even though it had been a scary and awful day, I was thankful that we had a plan and hopeful that Dr. Welch could help cure Caroline of these allergies.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p></span>"|36ab/12ab/tC1qiir2cwc56UP.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-11-01 17:15:42|2023-11-01 17:27:05
13|Katie Manning|The SLIT and OIT Process: Caroline's Journey||"<span><h2><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Sublingual Immunotherapy</span><br></h2><br><p dir=""ltr""><span>Due to the severity of Caroline&#8217;s allergies, Dr. Welch said that it would be necessary to start with Sublingual Immunotherapy (&#8220;SLIT&#8221;) before beginning Oral Immunotherapy.&#160; As I understand SLIT, the doctor mixes proteins of up to 20 different allergens in a glycerin solution.&#160; This solution is administered as drops placed under the patient&#8217;s tongue daily.&#160; He was able to include all of Caroline&#8217;s allergens in the mixture.&#160; There were four separate solutions, each solution becoming more and more concentrated each time.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>For our first appointment, the nurses took Caroline&#8217;s vitals (blood pressure, temperature, and pulse/oxygen saturation) and then administered one drop of the least concentrated solution under her tongue.&#160; Then we waited 20-minutes.&#160; They took Caroline&#8217;s vitals again.&#160; Then, they gave her two drops of the same solution under her tongue.&#160; Then another 20-minute wait period, and vitals.&#160; Then three drops, 20-minute wait, vitals, and four drops, 20-minute wait and vitals.&#160; All in all the appointment took around 3 hours.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>When we went home, every morning, I would give Caroline her the number of drops that we stopped at from the previous appointment (so usually 4 drops) under her tongue in the morning.&#160; She had to wait 15-20 minutes before eating or drinking anything so that the drops could be absorbed.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>I was able to make an appointment each week, so there was usually about a week between each &#8220;updosing&#8221; appointment.&#160; Caroline worked her way up to the most concentrated solution over a total of 5 visits.&#160; We hoped that it would only take 4 visits, but at one visit, Caroline appeared to have a swollen lip, so Dr. Welch said that we should wait and stay where we were and not updose.&#160; We waited another week and then her immune system was ready for 4 drops of the 1:1 solution, which is considered maintenance of SLIT.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>&#160;</span><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Since Caroline had completed SLIT, Dr. Welch felt more confident that it would be safe to give Caroline the actual allergens through OIT.&#160; Even throughout the whole OIT process, I still gave Caroline 4 pumps of the 1:1 SLIT solution.&#160;&#160;</span></p><br><h2><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Peanut &amp; Tree Nut Oral Immunotherapy&#160;&#160;</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Because Caroline&#8217;s nut and seed allergies were so severe, we started OIT to address them first.&#160; Again, I scheduled appointments once a week, so we had about a week between each appointment for her immune system to adjust to the new dosage levels.&#160; It took about 12 appointments over 12 weeks for Caroline to &#8220;graduate.&#8221;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Each appointment was around three hours and was very similar to the structure of the SLIT appointments &#8211; vitals, updose, 20-minute wait, repeat.&#160; Caroline was given very tiny amounts of her allergens mixed with a white powder.&#160; Caroline had to choose her &#8220;mixer&#8221; for her doses since she now had to eat the dose.&#160; Dr. Welch had the applesauce, or chocolate or vanilla pudding.&#160; Caroline did well with applesauce in the beginning.&#160; The concentration became higher and higher with each dose and each appointment.&#160; We were sent home with plastic cups of pre-measured doses for the level where Caroline ended at that appointment.&#160; I gave her those doses at home until we went back to the next appointment for an updose.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Caroline was not supposed to be very active for 1-2 hours after administering her dose, so we had to be mindful to keep her relatively calm and not engage in any activities that increased her heart rate following her dose.&#160; This could sometimes be a challenge with a 3-year-old, but thankfully she never had any serious reactions in this regard.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Although I was very nervous about Caroline suffering from adverse reactions throughout this process, I was very pleasantly surprised that she never got close to having any anaphylactic reactions.&#160; From what I observed and could glean from a 3-year-old, the side effects that Caroline experienced were mostly gastrointestinal issues, like abdominal discomfort and diarrhea.&#160; One day, I gave Caroline the dose and then drove to her appointment in Bellevue.&#160; Just as we were pulling up to the office, she vomited.&#160; Dr. Welch said that we should not updose that day and just stay at the same level we were at in case her immune system was adjusting.&#160; It was disappointing to not make progress after making the trip, but I appreciated that Dr. Welch was erring on the side of caution.&#160; Thankfully, this only happened once throughout the nut OIT process.</span></p><br><h2><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Challenges</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span>As the weeks went on and doses became more concentrated and larger, it became too much for her 3-year-old body to eat daily.&#160; Dr. Welch said that it was time to do some challenges to weed out some of the nuts that Caroline needed to take every day.&#160; The four nuts that were too dangerous to even challenge based on her blood and skin results were:&#160; peanut, Brazil nut, pistachio, and cashew.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>We had separate appointments for each of the other nuts (walnut, pecan, hazelnut, almond, etc.) to &#8220;challenge&#8221; them because her blood and skin results were much lower.&#160; I remember being very scared, but because we were so far along in the OIT process already, Dr. Welch assured me that they would go slowly and that she likely already had some tolerance to them from doing OIT.&#160; The appointments were structured like SLIT and OIT appointments &#8211; where they would give a little bit and then wait and then give a bit more over several hours.&#160; Thankfully, she passed all of these challenges and never had any adverse reactions.</span></p><br><h2><span>Peanut &amp; Tree Nut Oral Immunotherapy Graduation</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span>On June 13, 2018, Caroline graduated her peanut and tree nut oral immunotherapy!&#160; This meant that she had reached her maintenance dose, that she would continue daily for years.&#160; Her final dose was 4 grams peanut, 2 grams brazil nut, 2 grams pistachio, and 2 grams cashew daily.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>This also meant that we no longer needed to worry about cross contamination for any of her peanut or tree nut allergens and she was safe from accidental exposure.&#160; This was an amazing milestone.&#160; However, since we knew she had yet to complete her soy oral immunotherapy, we did not make any changes to our lifestyle or diet yet.</span></p><br><h2><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>Soy Oral Immunotherapy&#160;</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>The week after her peanut and tree nut immunotherapy graduation, Caroline started her soy immunotherapy.&#160; Instead of eating soy, Caroline would be drinking diluted soy milk, slowly increasing the concentration over each visit.&#160; Structurally, these visits were the same as the SLIT and nut OIT visits.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>We were grateful that Caroline made it through her soy immune therapy without incident.&#160; On August 8, 2018, Caroline graduated her soy immunotherapy.&#160; Her daily maintenance dose of soy milk was 120 mL of soy milk per dose.&#160; Thankfully, Caroline liked the taste of vanilla soy milk and it was not difficult for her to drink.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Caroline had suffered from chronic constipation since she was an infant, that never abated no matter what adjustments we made to her diet.&#160; She had been on medication for this since she was a baby.&#160; However, the week that she graduated soy OIT, her digestion became regular without medication for the first time in her life.&#160; She has never needed medication for digestion since &#8211; it&#8217;s been over 5 years at this point.&#160; Clearly her severe food allergies and her digestion were very related.&#160; The disappearance of her chronic digestive issues was a very welcome surprise!</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Finally, Caroline started her first year of preschool exactly one week after graduating from her soy therapy.&#160; We spent the spring and summer devoted to SLIT, nut OIT, challenges, and soy OIT and it paid off right in time for her to go off to school. Although we still sent her with EpiPens, we felt so much gratitude and relief that she was in a much safer position than she had previously been just months beforehand.&#160;</span></p><br><h2><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>How to Survive Appointments &amp; Doses&#160;</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>I&#8217;m sure that every parent will manage these several hour-long appointments (and potentially drives) in a way that works for them.&#160; However, here are some suggestions that helped us:&#160; a new sticker book or coloring book for each visit; candy for after each visit; ipad games during visits; a present they choose after each graduation (Caroline always chose a princess dress, as many 3-year-old girls may do); restaurant meals as encouragement or celebration for a certain number of doses; and lots of encouragement about what doing this dose will mean for them.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Still, several years later, Caroline will complain or resist us when she has to do her dose.&#160; She also doesn&#8217;t really remember life before her dose.&#160; We have to remind her of all that the dose enables her to do, like eat at the lunch table with her friends, travel without worry, eat at restaurants, enjoy ice cream, etc.&#160; The benefits abound and sometimes they just need to be reminded of all they get to do as a result.&#160; But we also commiserate with her and acknowledge what a bummer it is that she has to eat something she hates to often.&#160; </span></p><p><span><br></span></p></span>"|36ab/13ab/MgIFfU1cvYXHXMV.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-11-01 17:19:39|2023-11-01 17:27:11
14|Katie Manning|Life after SLIT and OIT: A Mother's Perspective||"<span><h2>Maintenance Phase</h2><p dir=""ltr""><span>Since she had graduated, we were now responsible for measuring Caroline&#8217;s doses each day.&#160; Dr. Welch&#8217;s office showed us how to measure Caroline&#8217;s doses using a jeweler&#8217;s scale and small plastic cups we purchased from Amazon.&#160; Each month, my husband and I would grind up each of the nuts individually.&#160; Then we put them in plastic bags and measured out one month&#8217;s worth of doses at a time.&#160; This generally took a couple of hours to do.&#160; This was a much better trade off compared to how hard life was before OIT &#8211; we were happy to do the work if it meant our child was safe.&#160; We mixed her dose with chocolate pudding because it&#8217;s the best way we found that she would eat it without too much discomfort or complaint.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>I purchased two plastic graduated cylinders from Amazon for measuring Caroline&#8217;s 120 mL soy milk doses each morning.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>At the point that Caroline underwent OIT in 2018, all of Dr. Welch&#8217;s OIT patients had to do doses </span><span>twice</span><span> a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.&#160; A couple of months after Caroline had graduated both nut and soy OIT protocols, we were informed that the research showed that we only had to give her dose </span><span>once </span><span>a day to keep her tolerance.&#160; This was a welcome change and made a huge difference in our day to day lives!</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Each morning, Caroline would wake up and we would mix her doses with chocolate pudding and give her the 120 mL of soy milk.&#160; Then she would go about her day as a normal child.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>It took us a while to get used to the fact that we did not need to be as fearful anymore.&#160; After so many years of hyper-vigilance, it took a while to loosen our grip and dip our toe into the world of foods Caroline and our family could now enjoy We slowly introduced foods that she had never had before &#8211; ice cream for example.&#160; We went out to eat at restaurant, and although we asked about the ingredients in foods, we did not have to worry about the surfaces that the foods were prepared on or inadvertent cross contamination.&#160; I still remember staring at her face each time she would eat something new &#8211; looking for a hive or swelling, overreacting to a cough as she sipped water.&#160; However, after many months of exposure to new foods and environments and watching her eat her allergens every day in her dose, our whole family&#8217;s nervous systems were able to calm down.&#160; It was like releasing the valve on a pressure cooker and we were all able to relax without food allergies and Caroline&#8217;s safety being at the top of our minds all of the time.</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>On Caroline&#8217;s 5</span><span><span>th</span></span><span> birthday, I remember ordering a &#8220;Paw Patrol&#8221; cake from a grocery store, which was a big deal for us.&#160; Her birthday party was full of friends and family that had been there for us during Caroline&#8217;s years before therapy and so we were all able to celebrate this moment as a big achievement for her.&#160; She was able to live life as a normal kid and a birthday party could be fun and not a stressful event for our family.&#160;</span></p><br><h2><span>Life Now, 5 Years Later</span></h2><p dir=""ltr""><span>Caroline is 8.5 years old, on her way to being a third grader.&#160; Many of the kids that she has met in recent years don&#8217;t even know that Caroline has allergies at all, let alone that they used to be so severe.&#160; The best part of OIT is that it has enabled Caroline to grow and just be who she is - not just &#8220;the kid with allergies&#8221; in every situation she enters.&#160; We still carry EpiPens everywhere, but we know that it is unlikely that we will need to use them.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Caroline has been able to eat birthday treats in class many times this year.&#160; She just reads the label and knows that, as long as it doesn&#8217;t contain her allergens, that she can likely eat it.&#160; And we both know that she&#8217;s not in a dangerous situation if there is an accidental exposure.&#160; She also gets to eat at the lunch table with her friends and even eats hamburgers in the cafeteria every Wednesday.&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Caroline saw Dr. Welch a couple of months ago for a follow up blood and skin test.&#160; Her skin test revealed no hives at all for peanuts, tree nuts or soy.&#160; Her blood test results show major improvement with all of these allergens &#8211; soy dropping from 28.9 to 2.84; Brazil nut and cashew from &gt;100 to 4.5 and 3.23.&#160; As an added bonus, she also had an environmental skin test that revealed NO environmental allergies.&#160; Dr. Welch said that kids that undergo this treatment can sometimes resolve or prevent environmental allergies.&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span>Because of her vast improvement with these allergens, Caroline no longer needs to eat them every day.&#160; She now just does her dose of peanuts, tree nuts, and soy twice a week.&#160; I mix the peanuts and all of the tree nuts with pudding and she eats them twice a week to maintain her tolerance.&#160; This is a small price to pay for the freedom that she now has.&#160;</span></p><p dir=""ltr""><span><span class=""Apple-tab-span"">&#9;</span></span><span>I hope that all food allergy families can also experience this transformation in their lives!</span></p><p><span><br></span></p></span>"|36ab/14ab/CiSwelE67C8Xtzi.jpeg|1|1|1|2023-11-01 17:21:35|2023-11-01 17:26:47
