There are many items in the grocery store (granola bars, bread, ice cream etc…) that upon reading the ingredients you will see may contain peanuts or tree nuts. It is this “may contain” or “made in the same facility as” statements that companies that really start to limit the food items that someone with a nut allergy can have.',

        'The theory of oral immunotherapy (or OIT) is that if you slowly introduce something that you can\'t digest into your diet, then your body can slowly learn how to handle the food item. So this process for nuts starts with a small amount of nuts (0.001grams ish) and working your way up to 5g. It can be incredibly life-changing, although quite a bit of a commitment. This process can be done with more allergies than just nuts.',
        'This is not an FDA approved, though, so all costs for this has to come out of pocket. For me, every session was costing me around $500, and I was going every 2 weeks for a few months, so cost is definitely a barrier.',
        'The FDA approved version of OIT is a drug known as "Palforzia", made specifically for peanuts.  Palforzia are small capsules full of small amounts of peanut, and you work on increasing that amount slowly until you can consume 1g of peanut. Because it is FDA approved, cost can be less of a barrier, but it does not take you as far as OIT, and is not as flexible for those with a variety of allergies. But, this treatment is still incredibly life changing.'
